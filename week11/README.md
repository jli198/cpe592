# Readme (Week 11)

Hi all, </br>
</br>
Last week, we went through the basics of Wireless Networks. So, let us start this week with security in Wireless Networks. Wireless Network is significantly different; relatively slower speed, mobility, and channel impairments are some reasons why security systems are redesigned for Wireless Networks. </br>
</br>
We start with a quick primer on Frequency Hopping, Direct Sequence, and Spread Spectrum mechanisms. You will be able to learn this in detail in Signal Processing and Communication System courses. </br>
</br>
Then, we readily dive into Security in WiFi Networks. Theoretically, Wireless signals can be received by anyone, and capacity due to collisio nand interference is a concern. Therefore, security in Wireless constitutes two components: encryption to garble communicated content and association, not letting anyone join the network. </br>
</br>
We all have first-hand experience with "Association" when we use passwords in-home/school WiFi. So, first, we talk about WPA and WEP in this context. Then we jump to security attacks in WiFi networks (Unauthorized access, cracking encryption, Rogue Access Points, Sniffing, Man in the Middle). Then, we talk about IEEE 802.11i and How EAP is used to mitigate these vulnerabilities. </br>
</br>
I have added a couple of PDFs on these topics. </br>
</br>
I hope you will enjoy this topic. </br>
