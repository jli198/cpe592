# Readme (Week 0)

## Motivation

Our topic this week is "Watermarking and Steganography." Before we get into this, let us imagine what if we had a Facebook or Instagram-like image-sharing application. It allows us to write comments only visible to a specific set of friends. How about a photo album consisting of multiple copies of usual images, hiding some other images only visible over the specific applications to a specific set of people? We are talking about "Steganogtaphy". It is an art/science of writing information/data on images such that the output images remain visibly the same. </br>
</br>
Some of you might relate this to watermarking. We will learn more about it in the coming weeks.

## Structure

This week's content will introduce you to this topic. We will further discuss these during the course of 3 weeks, piece by piece. Then we will have another week to review this content and read additional literature. Meanwhile, you can always reach out over email to discuss these topics. </br>

This week, we have a slide and a paper to read. This paper "Exploring Steganography: Seeing the Unseen" is very interesting. I hope it will intrigue you. </br>
</br>
*Note:* Please go through the resource provided. You may need to refresh your probability and communication theory a little. </br>
</br>
*Like to code?* </br>
Please find out what are some interesting tools and libraries available to write a text within the image. We will discuss this next week anyways. </br>
</br>
*Fun exercise:* </br>
Please open any image (JPEG or PNG) on you computer using a text editor, then write something on it. Are you able to open it as an image after closing the text editor?
