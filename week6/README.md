# Readme - Data-Encryption

Hi all, </br>
</br>
I hope you have enjoyed last week's content. After a basic introduction to Computer Security, we are now looking at encryption mechanisms this week. You can see some resemblance of this content without the previous watermarking courses. We are going to talk about how to hide information in binary/ASCII. </br>
</br>
We start with some definitions. Then, we talk about "encryption and decryption keys." When we have one set, we have a symmetric system, and keys are known as Private Key Encryption. But when we can have multiple sets of Decryption keys for a unique encryption key, We have Public Key Encryption. In this system, someone with the decryption key can decrypt the message but can not generate a new one. We will see how digital signatures assist Public encryption schemes. We will learn DES as Private encryption and RSA as a Public encryption standard. </br>
</br>
Then, we formally discuss the differences and similarities between watermarking and encrypted communication. We will see how the covert channel replaces images in encrypted communication. We will understand different types of covert channels using the examples of Alice, Bob, and Trudy. </br>
</br>
I have added a couple of book chapters related to this week's content. It will be helpful. I am also posting an assignment this week. </br>
</br>
Please feel free to reach out with any concerns you have. </br>
