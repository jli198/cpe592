# Readme (Week 1)

## Motivation

I hope you enjoyed last week's material. With a basic understanding of watermarking and steganography, it is time to learn some mechanisms. We had some discussion of LSB-based steganography in last week's literature. We will explore it this week in detail. </br>
Suppose some of you have tried editing images manually using a text editor or programmatically. You might have a corrupted image file. We will learn how to do it right now.

## Structure

We will start with different terminologies used in Steganography. We will talk about Watermarking specifically. We will learn LSB and JPEG-based mechanisms since JPEG is involved topic. We will digress a little to see how JPEG encoding and compression work. </br>
By the end of the lecture, you will have a fair idea of writing a sentence underneath a digital image. </br>
This week's content includes a lecture slide and an article discussing digital watermarking. There is an assignment, too. Please submit it by the end of next week (Sunday midnight). </br>
Note: </br>
Feel free to submit a pseudo code for the coding assignment with a detailed list of assumptions.
