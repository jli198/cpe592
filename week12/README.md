# Readme Week 12

Hi all, </br>
</br>
I hope you all are well. If any of you need any assistance, please email me. </br>
</br>
This is the last 'actual' class of this course. I want to congratulate you all. I will put some research papers next week for the literature review. Later next week, I will post the final project, too. There will be no further assignments and quizzes. The final project will be one real-life project where you must design a secure system. It will be fun. </br>
</br>
This week, we start with addressing the Ad-hoc network. 3G/4G/5G and WiFi are predominantly cellular. As a wireless network engineer, you will see people use non-Ad-hoc (Cellular) networks. But Ad-hoc is something that always attracts everyone. It has the potential for better spectrum utilization, fail-tolerance, robustness, etc. With IoT, LoRaWAN, BLE, etc, the Ad-hoc network has resurfaced. </br>
</br>
We start with basic definitions by introducing MANETs and WSNs. Unlike cellular networks, these networks are designed to have a man-in-middle on every hop. Often, fault tolerance and self-healing networks are added constraints, which makes securing it an interesting research problem. We discuss here different types of attacks in MANETs. We briefly talk about routing protocols to discuss "Routing Protocol Attacks." These attacks are triggered by malicious ndoes spreading misinformation and undermining topology via tunneling, spoofing, etc. Since MANETs are cooperative networks, Selfishness is undesriable and even a security threat. We talk about selfish node detection and preventive measures. We also talk about key management in MANETs. </br>
</br>
Then, we move to Bluetooth networks and their security concerns. Bluetooth-based malware and attacks are persistent. It typically affects billions of devices every year. We talk about Bluetooth protocols and various security modes. We conclude this section with an enumeration of the challenges and vulnerabilities of Bluetooth networks. </br>
</br>
I have added Hubax's paper on MANET security for further reading. </br>
