# Readme (Week 8)

Hi all, </br>
</br>
Welcome to the last module of this segment on "Network Security." This week, we will be looking at different publications. Please look into the latest research work in this domain. </br>
</br>
I am posting a few papers/book chapters. </br>
</br>
PublicCrpyt.pdf: This book chapter addresses the Public Key Cryptosystem, its efficiency, and various types of attacks/security threats. </br>
</br>
Micropayments.pdf: This chapter talks about how digital payments/online transfer works. Please read carefully, as this is one of the frequently used applications of various network security mechanisms we have discussed. </br>
</br>
Please feel free to message me with any concerns you have. </br>
</br>
Regards </br>
Vidya Sagar
