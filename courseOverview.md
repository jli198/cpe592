# Course Overview

## Introduction

This is an introductory course on security issues in multimedia content (digital image, video), wireless and wired network security. Topics such as digital watermarking, digital steganography, basic cryptography, wireless security protocols, etc. will be discussed.

## Learning Objectives

* Students will understand security issues and threats against computers and multimedia networks
* Students will learn to design digital watermarking algorithms for multimedia data
* Students will implement digital watermarking algorithms
* Students will understand basic concepts of encryption and decryption
* Students will learn to implement at least one encryption and decryption algorithm
* Students will understand issues related to wireless security protocols
* Students will be able to present security issues related to emerging wireless technologies

## Course Structure

This course is organized in three broader yet interrlated sections:

1. Watermarking and Steganography
2. Computer and Network Security
3. Wireless Network Security

We will have one week for literature review and discussion upon completion of each of these sections. </br>
There will be one Midterm examination and one final Project. </br>
Assignments will have some coding tasks. Please feel free to code in any common programming language (C/C++/JAVA/Matlab/JavaScript). This is not a computer language course; therefore, coding assignments will be graded mostly of algorithm and methodologies. </br>
Please reach out for any question and query you may have. I am available over [email](vsagar@stevens.edu) and Canvas.
