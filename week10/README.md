# Readme (Week 10)

Hi all, </br>
</br>
I hope you all have no issues with the Midterm. You still have this week to work on it. Please send me your concerns via email/canvas. </br>
</br>
Meanwhile, Let us kick-start the last segment of this course work -- "Wireless Network and Security." </br>
</br>
We start with a quick introduction to WiFi. WiFi Network (e.g., Stevens network) can be termed as an Extended Service Set (ESS), which consists of multiple Basic Service Set (BSS) (e.g., WiFi Guest, WiFi for Students and Faculty). A BSS typically allows association, encryption, and IP allocation for WiFi clients (Phone, Laptop, etc). In the home scenario, home WiFi represents stand-alone BSS. </br>
</br>
Wireless Networks generally have two topologies: Infrastructure or Cellular Mode and Ah-hoc or Mesh Mode. In Infrastructure mode, usually, a central node connects and dictates communication protocols for all nodes. In Ad-hoc mode, all nodes are alike, using previously agreed-upon mechanisms to communicate. To communicate with peers or next-hop, Wireless devices make use of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. IEEE has standardized WiFi, WiMAX, and Bluetooth Wireless MAC Protocols, 3GPP, another standard body, has devised 3G/4G/5G standards. </br>
</br>
MAC protocols are also used in Wireline networks, but they are paramount in Wireless domain. This is attributed to the shared nature of the wireless channels, potential interference, and variation in capacity with time, distance, frequency, and speed. There are many security aspects, too, which will be touched upon later. </br>
</br>
Most of the MAC protocols have one primary objective: to ensure communication happens. No two devices send signals simultaneously, causing "Collision" and resulting in "garbled" messages for others. CSMA is one of the basic protocols adopted in WiFi standards. In CSMA, a wireless node listens for ongoing communication and transmits only if it finds the absence of any contact on the desired frequency for a certain amount of time. The intended recipient is expected to "acknowledge" the received message. There are some issues with pure CSMA related to reliability and hidden nodes. We will discuss how re-transmission and RTS/CTS address these concerns. </br>

I am adding two additional PDFs; I hope it helps you all. </br>
