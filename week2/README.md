# Readme

## Motivation

I assume you all are enjoying the first assignment. </br>
</br>
Since we know how to write our name underneath encoded layers of the image. </br>
This is time time to explor it further. Let me start with some questions that I will try to address this week

1. How much data can we write?
2. Can we detect such an inscription?
3. What happens if we edit images?
4. Can we remove such images?
5. Can we ensure that no one can edit/detect or alter such information?

We are talking about robustness now. This is the topic of the week. </br>
</br>
We will discuss fragile and robust steganography. We will se how applying DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) improves robustness. Then, we also look at spread spectrum watermarking, which uses advanced image processing mechanisms. We will talk about tempering and how to detect watermarks even if tempered. </br>
</br>
We will also discuss watermaking in videos and learn MPEG encoding.

### Structure

We have slides and two papers to read. There is no assignment this week. </br>
I hope you will enjoy this material. Please feel free to reach me with any concerns.
