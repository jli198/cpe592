# Readme (Week 3)

Hi all, </br>

This week, we are analyzing Steganography. I assume you have studied "Kullback-Leibler divergence" in Probability/Information Theory classes. Please refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) for quick reference. </br>
It gives a measure to find differences in two random events. </br>
</br>
Let us ask how we can answer whether a "given" image has a stego text if we know the distribution of data underneath from the "original" image and compare it with the same "given" image. We will see a possible variation if there is any modification due to stego text. This "variation" can be quantified by the above metric. </br>
</br>
We talk about what is a perfect Stego system. "One that can be detected." In other words, if the probability density of original media and stego media is alike. It will be tough to detect, and divergence will be zero.
</br>
We then talk about the probability of detecting secret messages. We discuss a little "robustness" and "security" trade-off. The main idea is we try to make a perfect stego (The highest security), but it will need to be more robust. Any modification to media will result in the corruption of the seret text. </br>
</br>
We discuss the type of attacks designed around this concept. Then, we talk about passive and active Steganalysis. How can we use Supervised and Statistical learning for detection? We also look at how Wavelet transform can be employed in it. </br>
</br>
This covers this week's content. </br>
</br>
I have added two papers that discuss these topics in depth. We have an assignment this week. </br>
</br>
Please submit it by midnight next Sunday (2nd Oct). </br>
</br>
Regards </br>
