# Readme (Week 7)

Hi all, </br>
</br>
This is the third week of this module. We will continue to understand Network Security, threats, and mitigating techniques. This week, we start with different types of Attacks (Active and Passive). We will see active attacks affect intended communication directly. Passive attack affects confidentiality, integrity, or secrecy of communication without impacting ongoing communication. </br>
</br>
What is the primary way to avert these attacks? Unfortunately, there is none. The most popular approach is a key exchange, ensuring a unique pair of keys between the intended sender and recipients. We always do such exchanges using web browsers, email, and chat applications. I recommend reading how HTTPS/SSL/TLS works. </br>
</br>
Like Steganalysis, we talk about robustness in this module, too. Here, robustness in public key exchanges implies how long the "digital computer" will take to "break" or estimate the original key combination. </br>
</br>
We will also talk about block cipher mechanisms DES and TDEA. We will talk about the location of encryption and decryption. We will see the utility of padding and hashing for secure key exchanges. Finally, we touch upon the tunnel and encapsulation of these key exchanges. </br>
</br>
I have also added two interesting papers for this week to read. </br>
</br>
Regards </br>
