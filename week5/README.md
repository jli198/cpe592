# Readme (Week 5)

Hi all, </br>
Welcome to another section of this coursework. We will talk about "Computer Security" in this section. This is the first week of this section. We will start with an elementary introduction to Computer Security this week. </br>
We all already have some familiarity with computer security and its vulnerability. </br>
Before starting this topic, [please review this post](https://thestute.com/2019/09/13/major-cyberattack-shuts-down-stevens-for-weeks/) to understand what happened in Stevens in Fall 2019. </br>
</br>
These unfortunate events are happening everywhere in the government and corporate world alike. We will have a better understanding of it through this course. </br>
When we talk about attacks or computer security attacks, we mean that someone has exploited "vulnerabilities" of computers, networks, or both. We will learn the basic definitions of these terms. We will also discuss different types of attacks (Denial of Service attacks, etc). </br>
We will introduce "Intrusion" and talk about intrusion detection and Passwords. </br>
I am attaching a few research papers to understand you better. </br>
</br>
Regards </br>
Vidya Sagar
