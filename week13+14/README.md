# Read me Week 13

Hi all, </br>
</br>
This week, I have a few pieces of literature to read. This literature discusses some of the security concerns specific to wireless networks. </br>
</br>
As usual, I will encourage you to research these issues using library resources. Please take this week to review research work in this area and best practices in this domain. </br>
</br>
I am also posting the Final Project. You will have three weeks to complete it. </br>
</br>
I would also like to congratulate you all for your excellent performance in the mid-terms. </br>
</br>
I wish you all the best. </br>
</br>
Regards
Vidya Sagar
